By adopting the concepts Shapelet and Matrix Profile, we conduct the first attempt to extract the adaptive features from Time Series Stream, two streaming contexts are considered: 
- For data source with stable concept, learning model will be updated incrementally; 
- For data source with drifting concept, we extract the adaptive features under the most recent concept

### Main contributions:

1. A novel strategy to evaluate Shapelet, which shows the first attempt of transferring the techniques in Time Series community to Data Stream community

2. Test-then-Train Stategy: The novel strategy, not only accelerates the incremental Shapelet extraction in stable-concept context, but also helps with detecting Concept Drift in streaming context.

4. Scalability & Explainability 

5. Traceability of extracted features

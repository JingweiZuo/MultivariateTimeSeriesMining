By adopting the concepts Shapelet and Matrix Profile, we conduct the first attempt to extract the adaptive features from Time Series Stream, two streaming contexts are considered: 
- For data source with stable concept, learning model will be updated incrementally; 
- For data source with drifting concept, we extract the adaptive features under the most recent concept
